* ThePEG-1.1.2 release: 2008-02-25
** Bug #136: dSigHatDR
   Efficiency improvement for zero PDF.

** Bug #137: HepMC conversion
   The HepMC converter now takes a unit argument to specify which
   energy and length units should be used in the HepMC event.

** Bug #140 / #141: Crash on shutdown
   This fixes a bug introduced in 1.1.1. External code interfaces
   should now work again. 

** Bug #151: Loop in Remnant record
   The loop between remnants in the event record has been removed.

** PDF improvements
   Fix to handling of maximum flavour from LHAPDF. Fix for xmin
   calculation. 




* ThePEG-1.1.1 release: 2007-12-07
** Bug #46: Reproducibility
   Fixed a problem where runs were not identical for a given random
   number seed. You now _must_ reset the seed if you need independent
   event generator runs.  

** Detection of gcc abs bug
   http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=34130
   configure now checks for and works around the gcc abs() bug.

** Separate LWHFactory library
   Fixed problem in Rivet interaction by factoring out LWHFactory into
   its own dynamic library.




* ThePEG-1.1.0 release: 2007-11-20
** New vector classes
   ThePEG now uses its own internal Vector classes, making it
   independent of CLHEP.

** New dimension checking mechanism
   Optionally, any physical expression is checked for dimensional
   correctness at compile time.

** Extended Helicity classes
   A full set of helicity amplitude classes has been transferred from
   Herwig++. 

** unlisted
  Many other improvements and small bug fixes, see ChangeLog.




* ThePEG-1.0.1 release: 2006-11-22

** unlisted:
   Fixed memory leak in LesHouchesReader.

** Bug #58
   maximumCMEnergy() member of the EventGenerator returns zero. See
   ChangeLog entry 2006-10-06

** Bug #62
   fixed 'const' behaviour in Lorentz spinor classes

** Bug #68
   Improved error message for switch options

** unlisted
   Improved compile-time LHAPDF library and include file handling.

** unlisted
   Bug in IteratorRange::rrange(const Container &).

** unlisted
   fixed Selector::swap()

** unlisted
   Bug in ClusterCollapser where no colour-singlet particles were
   considered for momentum compensation if no coloured particles were
   present. 

** unlisted
   Bug in LeptonLeptonRemnant: minX variable not persistent

** unlisted
   scale of the produced coloured particles was not set in
   Onium3GDecayer and ColourPairDecayer

** unlisted
   unused default path removed from DynamicLoader
