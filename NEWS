===============================

Numbered bugs can be found at
 http://projects.hepforge.org/herwig/trac/ticket/NN
where NN is the bug number.

The latest version of ThePEG can be found at http://www.thep.lu.se/ThePEG
or at http:///projects.hepforge.org/herwig/versions

* ThePEG-1.3.0 release: 2008-06-20
** Statistical errors
   Error estimates on the cross-sections are now reported in the .out files.

** Decaymode setup
   The decaymode setup has been reworked, keeping backwards
   compatibility. The 'defaultparticle' command has been removed.

** Madgraph reader
   Updated to latest Madevent version. 

** LHAPDF improvements
   lhapdf-config is not used anymore to determine the location of the
   PDF sets. Instead, they are fixed at configure-time.

** HepMC 
   The beam particles are now set correctly.

** Arbitrary search paths for .in files
   Input files don't have to be in '.', use '-I' to specify additional
   directories.

** Ticket #172
   Fix for cuts in mirrored processes.

** Simpler emacs macros
   The emacs macros have been significantly cleaned up.

** Helicity vertex classes
   Potential prolems with uninitialized variables were fixed. No
   actual bugs had occurred from here.

** Memory leak fixes and performance
   Several loops of shared pointers were fixed involving DecayModes
   and ParticleData. FixedSizeAllocator was removed, the regular 'new'
   and 'delete' is now used for all allocations, giving a 5% speedup.  

* ThePEG-1.2.0 release: 2008-04-18
** ThePEG uses GSL 
   The GNU Scientific Library and its headers are now required for
   building ThePEG. RandomGenerator partially uses GSL now.

** Ticket #160: HepMC converter 
   Optionally, the HepMC converter can fill an external GenEvent object,
   instead of newing one internally.

** 'globallibrary' command
   The 'globallibrary' command can be used to register libraries which
   are useful for the whole run. They do not need to be listed in each
   class's library() function.

** Resume from dump files (also solves #149)
   The --resume command line flag instructs runThePEG to resume the
   run from a previous dump file. 'set Generator:DumpPeriod 1000'
   writes such a checkpoint every 1000 events.

** New Repository interface (also solves #141)
   The repository now provides a Repository::cleanup() method, to be
   called at the end of a run. Alternatively, a Repository object can
   be created and its member functions called. 

** Les Houches interface improvements.
   LesHouchesReader had had a major overhaul.

** XSecCheck analysis
   Issues a warning if a target cross section is not met in the run.

** Weighted events
   Handling of weighted events was improved.

** Ticket #124: 'Deleted' interface option 
   Interfaces can be declared obsolete, a warning will be issued when
   they're used. 

** LHAPDF interface 
   The interface now allows photons as partons inside a hadron.

** gcc 4.3.0
   ThePEG compiles cleanly with the new gcc 4.3 series.

** Bug #138
   Lepton NoPDF now works.




* ThePEG-1.1.2 release: 2008-02-25
** Bug #136: dSigHatDR
   Efficiency improvement for zero PDF.

** Bug #137: HepMC conversion
   The HepMC converter now takes a unit argument to specify which
   energy and length units should be used in the HepMC event.

** Bug #140 / #141: Crash on shutdown
   This fixes a bug introduced in 1.1.1. External code interfaces
   should now work again. 

** Bug #151: Loop in Remnant record
   The loop between remnants in the event record has been removed.

** PDF improvements
   Fix to handling of maximum flavour from LHAPDF. Fix for xmin
   calculation. 




* ThePEG-1.1.1 release: 2007-12-07
** Bug #46: Reproducibility
   Fixed a problem where runs were not identical for a given random
   number seed. You now _must_ reset the seed if you need independent
   event generator runs.  

** Detection of gcc abs bug
   http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=34130
   configure now checks for and works around the gcc abs() bug.

** Separate LWHFactory library
   Fixed problem in Rivet interaction by factoring out LWHFactory into
   its own dynamic library.




* ThePEG-1.1.0 release: 2007-11-20
** New vector classes
   ThePEG now uses its own internal Vector classes, making it
   independent of CLHEP.

** New dimension checking mechanism
   Optionally, any physical expression is checked for dimensional
   correctness at compile time.

** Extended Helicity classes
   A full set of helicity amplitude classes has been transferred from
   Herwig++. 

** unlisted
  Many other improvements and small bug fixes, see ChangeLog.




* ThePEG-1.0.1 release: 2006-11-22

** unlisted:
   Fixed memory leak in LesHouchesReader.

** Bug #58
   maximumCMEnergy() member of the EventGenerator returns zero. See
   ChangeLog entry 2006-10-06

** Bug #62
   fixed 'const' behaviour in Lorentz spinor classes

** Bug #68
   Improved error message for switch options

** unlisted
   Improved compile-time LHAPDF library and include file handling.

** unlisted
   Bug in IteratorRange::rrange(const Container &).

** unlisted
   fixed Selector::swap()

** unlisted
   Bug in ClusterCollapser where no colour-singlet particles were
   considered for momentum compensation if no coloured particles were
   present. 

** unlisted
   Bug in LeptonLeptonRemnant: minX variable not persistent

** unlisted
   scale of the produced coloured particles was not set in
   Onium3GDecayer and ColourPairDecayer

** unlisted
   unused default path removed from DynamicLoader




* ThePEG-1.0 release: 2006-09-27
