Toolkit for High Energy Physics Event Generation - ThePEG

To compile and install ThePEG follow these steps:

1: run the configure script. To override the defaults: set the
   following environment variables

	CXX: (default g++) your favourite C++ compiler. Must be
	     standard compliant. g++ version 3.2 or later will do
	     nicely.

	CLHEPPATH: (default /usr/local) The path to the CLHEP
	     installation (version 1.8 or higher). The header files
	     will be seached for in $(CLHEPPATH)/include/CLHEP and the
	     library file in $(CLHEPPATH)/lib

	CLHEPLIB: (default CLHEP) The name of the CLHEP library. It
	     will be linked with -l$(CLHEPLIB). Note that if the CLHEP
	     is a static library it will be converted to a dynamicaly
	     linked one and installed in the lib directory of ThePEG.

   To overwrite the default install prefix (/usr/local) use the
   --prefix=/custom/install/path argument to configure.

2: In the main ThePEG directory, do 'make check'.
        this will compile the main ThePEG library and two programs in
        the src directory. These will then be run as follows
                ./setupThePEG SimpleLEP.in
        to setup an event generator which is dumped in SimpleLEP.run
	        ./runThePEG SimpleLEP.run
	to run the event generator. Some output will be written in
	SimpleLEP.out, SimpleLEP.log and SimpleLEP.tex.

3: Install ThePEG with 'make install'. This will put all the shared
   libraries in the lib/ThePEG/<version> directory under the install
   path. There will also be placed the default repository file
   'ThePEGDefaults.rpo' and the two executables 'setupThePEG.exe' and
   'runThePEG.exe'. The two executables are run indirectly from the
   scripts 'setupThePEG' and 'runThePEG' which are installed in the
   bin directory under the install path. In addition All header files
   will be installed in the 'include/ThePEG' directory under the
   install path.

Note that this version is not of production quality and results
produced with it should not be used for serious scientific
studies. This release is mainly intended to make public the basic
structure of the program.

There is currently no up-to-date manual avaliable. However, the
general structure is described in "PYTHIA version 7-0.0 - a
proof-of-concept version" Comput. Phys. Commun. 134 (2001) 365. (see
also http://www.thep.lu.se/Pythia7/Doc/Proof/). This describes the
Pythia7 program before it was broken up into the basic event generator
platform - ThePEG - and the Pythia-specific parts in Pythia7

Briefly, the running of ThePEG is divided into two steps:

1: The program 'setupThePEG' is used to set up an event generator and
   saving it to a file. Here you collect together the components
   needed for a specific event generation run, and parameters and
   switches of the components can be set to prefered values. See the
   file SimpleLEP.in in the src subdirectory for an example.

2: The program 'runThePEG' is used to run the generator saved to a
   file.
