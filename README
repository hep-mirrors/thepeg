*** This is a proof-of-concept of ThePEG ***

To compile and run a test program follow these steps:

1: run the configure script. To override the defaults: set the
   following environment variables

	CXX: (default g++) your favourite C++ compiler (if it is g++
             version 2.95.2 and if you are running on Linux you should
             be OK also egcs-1.1.2 may work. For other platforms, you
             are on your own!)

	CLHEPPATH: (default /usr/local) The path to the CLHEP
	     installation (version 1.4 or higher). The header files
             will be seached for in $(CLHEPPATH)/include/CLHEP and the
             library file in $(CLHEPPATH)/lib

	CLHEPLIB: (default CLHEP) The name of the CLHEP library. It
	     will be linked with -l$(CLHEPLIB)

2: In the main ThePEG directory, do 'make check'.
        this will compile the main ThePEG library and two programs in
        the src directory. These will then be run as follows
                ./setupThePEG SimpleLEP.in
        to setup an event generator which is dumped in SimpleLEP.run
	        ./runThePEG SimpleLEP.run
	to run the event generator. Some output will be written in
	SimpleLEP.out, SimpleLEP.log and SimpleLEP.tex.

3: To run the partial event generator example do in src
		make runPartial
		./runPartial SimpleLEP.run

compressed postscript file in Doc/Proof.ps.gz and as a html document
in Doc/Proof/Proof.html.

Note that this version is not of production quality and results
produced with it should not be used for serious scientific
studies. This release is mainly intended to make public the basic
structure of the program.
