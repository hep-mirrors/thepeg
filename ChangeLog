	* Repository/Repository.cc: Added code so that the load() command
	will look in the ThePEG_INSTALL_PATH for a .rpo file if the given
	filename did not exist.

	* First check-in of ThePEG. This is just what was previously
	Pythia7 but stripped from any pythia-specific classes.  Pythia7
	still exists but contains only pythia-specific classes which
	depend on ThePEG.

	Most significant change is that the 'Misc' directory has been
	removed and all classes therin has been moved to the 'Utilities'
	directory. 

	Another change is that 'make check' now only checks the SimpleLEP
	generator since the SimpleLHC generator was indirectly dependent
	on the FlavourGenerator in the pythia string fragmentation classes
	(used in the remnant handling).

	When compiling, the full compiler and link commands are now by
	default replaced by messages such as 'comiling xxx.cc ...' To see
	the full commands use the make-variable SHOWCOMMAND eg. 'make -k
	check SHOWCOMMAND=1'
