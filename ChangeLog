	* Repository/Repository.cc: Added code so that the load() command
	will look in the ThePEG_INSTALL_PATH for a .rpo file if the given
	filename did not exist.

	* First check-in of ThePEG. This is just what was previously
	Pythia7 but stripped from any pythia-specific classes.  Pythia7
	still exists but contains only pythia-specific classes which
	depend on ThePEG.
