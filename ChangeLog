	* acinclude.m4: Introduces AC_SEARCH_CLHEP and AC_SEARCH_THEPEG
	macros to replace AC_CHECK_CLHEP and AC_CHECK_THEPEG. The new
	macros will actively search for valid CLHEP and ThePEG
	installations in standard places.

2005-09-01  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* PDF/BaryonRemnants.*: Added option to always give di-quark when

	* CLHEPWrap/LorentzRotation.*: Changed some reference to double
	arguments to simple doubles. Changed returning _half and _one as
	const references instead of objects. Also introduced cast operator
	synonomous to one(). Introduces multiplication operators for

	to handle type_info pointers properly using type_info::before
	function.

	* Utilities/DescriptionList.*: Introduced conditional
	compilation. The map relating type_info pointers to
	ClassDescriptionBase objects does not work with dynamic linking
	under MAC OSX, therefore, if THEPEG_DYNAMIC_TYPE_INFO_BUG is
	defined, they are now instead indexed by the name() function of
	the type_info object.

2005-06-26  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Utilities/SimplePhaseSpace.tcc:  Fixed bug in angles of

	* lib/Makefile.am: Link all the shared libraries including the
	ones with version suffix and the ones ending with .la.

	* */Makefile.am, configure.ac: Moved -version-info to the
	individual _LDFLAGS variables in the Makefiles

	of a specified class. To be used in the Java GUI.

	* Handlers/StandardEventHandler.*, Handlers/StandardXComb.*:
	StandardXComb now uses the XSecStat class to collect
	statistics. It is not quite used as intended as the maximum cross

	the class a bit...

2005-05-27  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* LesHouches/MadGraphReader.*: Removed setting of XPDWUP giving
	the responsibility for that to the base class. Also renamed

	PDF/LeptonLeptonRemnant.*, PDF/BaryonRemnants.*: Changed the
	signatures of the generate() and recreateRemnants() functions to
	also require information about the shat of the subprocess, to
	allow the remnant handlers to catch situations where they might
	get into trouble with kinematics. The old functions are still
	there, but will be removed shortly.

	* LesHouches/LesHouchesEventHandler.cc: Added warnings about
	oversampling in the statistics() function.

	* MatrixElement/MEBase.h: (David Grellscheid) Now includes
	MEBase.fh as this is no longer done by LastXCombInfo.h.

	declaration of lastME(), which was needed and not
	implemented. Also removed the inclusioon of the MEBase.fh header
	file.

	PartonBinInstances should be negative. Also set the scale of the
	incoming and outgoing partons

	thePartonBinInstances, which eas not really neaded. Renamed the
	variable to partonBinInstances and cleared it in the beginning of
	the constructRemnants function.

	* PDF/PartonBin.h: Removed declaration of unimplemented functions.

2005-05-17  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	interfaces introduced to avoid ambiguities.

2005-05-16  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Utilities/Math.icc, Config/config.h.in, configure.in: Included
	check for existence of atanh (ThePEG_HAS_ATANH). This is a
	standard C function but is not always available on C++
	compilers. Also changed the implementation of Math::log1m in case
	neither log1p or atanh is available. If atanh is not available it
	is included in the Math namespace using log1m.

2005-04-25  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	PartonBin.fh.

2005-04-07  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Handlers/LastXCombInfo.h: Included PDF.h instead of PDF.fh,
	since gcc-4 insists on trying to compile a templated function even
	though it is not used.

	* Persistency/PersistentOStream.icc: Workaround for gcc-4
	defining tYes and tNo in a strange way.

2005-04-07  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	maximum sampling.

	* Handlers/ACDCSampler.*: Added a hint in the warning issued if a
	run ends while ACDC is in compensating mode, also made it a proper
	warning. Increased the default number of pre-samplings from 100 to
	1000.

2005-03-10  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* MatrixElement/ME2to2Base.cc: Fixed bug in calculatio of jacobian
	spotted by David Grellscheid. Only showed up if outgoing partons

2005-02-20  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Handlers/EventHandler.*: Modified EventHandler according to new
	hierarchy. Also made minor changes to other classes to make it
	compile. These changes needs to be attended to when the old
	classes are removed and are marked with the comment
	'*** OldEventHandler ATTENTION ***'.

2005-02-19  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* *** GLOBAL ***: Renamed EventHandler to OldEventHandler to
	prepare for new EventHandler hierarchy.

2005-02-08  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* lib/fixCLHEP: Copy libCLHEP.so rather than soft link since the
	CLHEP versioning system for shared libraries doesn't really work.

2005-01-07  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Handlers/StandardXComb.*, PDF/PartonExtractor.h,
	MatrixElement/MEBase.cc, Handlers/LastXCombInfo.h,
	Handlers/CollisionHandler.cc, Handlers/XComb.*: Changed slightly
	the interface for XComb, preparing for makeing it a base class
	with StandardXComb as a sub class implementing the standard
	ThePEG-specific sub process generation parts of XComb.

2004-12-30  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Repository/RandomGenerator.*: Added operator()(long) to conform
	to the random number generator requirements of the standard

	* lib/fixCLHEP: Fixed the script to use g++ instead of ld to
	create a shared library from the static CLHEP library. This should
	probably be a configure option in the future.

	parameters to avoid min/max functions and units.

2004-10-13  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Repository/BaseRepository.cc, Interface/InterfacedBase.*: Each
	interfaced object may now be assignrd a unique comment. If an
	interfaced object is being initialized with the setup command in
	the repository the non-virtual InterfacedBase::setup() function is
	called which in turn calls the virtual readSetup(). Everything in
	the stream supplied as argument which is not parsed by the
	readSetup functions will be treated as a comment.

	* Repository/Repository.cc: Added possibility in read() function
	to have continuation lines. If a command line end with a \
	the next line will be added.

2004-04-23  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* configure.in: Changed default optimization flag to -O2
	(otherwise things get slow with gcc 3.4.0).

	changed return type for rnd(OutputIterator, size_type n) to void.

	* Pointer/RCPtr.icc: Made implementations of swap explicit instead
	of using std::swap (problems with gcc 3.4.0).

	* Interface/Switch.tcc, Interface/Reference.tcc,
	Interface/RefVector.tcc, Interface/Parameter.tcc,
	Interface/ParVector.tcc: Added scope resolution to calls to
	readOnly, limited, and dependencySafe functions.

	* Interface/InterfacedBase.h: Made clear and reset functions
	public.

	* Interface/Switch.cc, Interface/Reference.cc,
	Interface/RefVector.cc, Interface/Parameter.cc,
	Interface/ParVector.cc, Interface/Command.cc: Moved include of
	InterfacedBase.h

	check methods for induvidual cuts for consistency reasons.

	* Handlers/KinematicalCuts.icc: Changed the methods mHat, sHat,
	pTHat, yStar, maxY, minY, maxEta, minEta. The treatment of <
	vs. <= is now better. See documentation for respective functions.

2004-03-31  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Persistency/PersistentOStream.cc: Minor changes to facilitate
	debugging.

	* Handlers/XComb.h, Handlers/CollisionHandler.cc,
	PDF/PartonExtractor.cc, PDF/PartonBin.*: The incoming PartonBin is
	now a transient pointer while the outgoing ones are reference
	counted (before it was vice versa). This is to avoid that outgoing
	PartonBins which are not used get deleted while the transient
	pointers are still around. Also the PartonExtractor was changed to
	reflect this change. In PartonExtractor::getPartons the bins
	corresponding to the incoming particles are also saved last in the
	returned vector to avoid them being deleted. This is then also
	taken care of in CollisionHandler::initialize.In addition, the
	XComb objects now also hold reference counted pointers to the bins
	corresponding to the incoming particles.

2004-03-27  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	representation in Lorentz spinors. Also fixed documentation.

2004-03-07  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	ThePEG structure. They have not been tested in this structure yet,
	but it compiles and links into ThePEG without any problems.

	* Helicity (Module): Added Peters helicity classes and started to
	integrate them into ThePEG.

	list of children and also remove this from the childs list of
	parents.

2003-11-19  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* lib/ThePEG.el: Made sure ClassTraits.h is included before class
	traits templates are specialized.

	* configure.in, Config/Makefile.common.in: Made configure steer
	all compiler flags and included info for --help option. Also
	changed the check for log1p and expm1 which caused problems under
	cygwin. Need to also fix a atanh check but no solution to that for
	cygwin yet.

2003-11-04  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* lib/Makefile, lib/fixCLHEP: If CLHEP is already in a dynamic

	the ACDCGenerator namespace to be compatible with CLHEP-2.0 and
	earlier versions.

	* Config/Units.h: Added using namespace CLHEP to be
	compatible with CLHEP-2.0 and earlier versions.

	* CLHEPWrap/CLHEP.h: Added an empty CLHEP namespace to be
	compatible with CLHEP-2.0 and earlier versions.

	ThePEG directory has to be cleaned last.

	* configure.in: Set the default CLHEPPATH to $prefix rather than
	hardcoded to /usr/local

2003-10-24  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* StandardModel/StandardModelBase.*: Changed CKM function to check
	if theCKM2Matrix has been generated by the CKM object before
	returning a matrix element.

2003-08-27  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* src/runThePEG.cc: If -x argument specifies a dynamic library, it
	is assumed to contain a class inheriting from Main and which has a

	* EventRecord/Collision.*, Handlers/PartialCollisionHandler.*:
	newStep() now have an optional argument to specify the step
	handler.

	* Handlers/StepHandler.cc: createNewStep now sets the handler to
	this.

2003-08-12  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	argument was anti-quark and and in setProbabilities() for diquark
	production. Fixed anti-particle bug in vectorMeson() and
	pseudoScalarMeson(). THe class seems to work now but physics not
	tested.

	* Handlers/FlavourGenerator.cc: Just changed error messages.

2003-08-01  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Handlers/FlavourGenerator.*: Added 'always' wrapper functions
	which call the virtual generateHadron(), getHadron() and
	getBaryon() functions which throws exceptions if no hadron could
	be generated.

2003-07-30  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	description has until now been on the form "/{namespace}/{class}"
	In the future it should instead be on the more natural form
	"{namespace}::{class}". Before the new naming scheme is enforced
	class descriptions will be registered in both the old and new
	form.

	* Repository/BaseRepository.*: Added remove(ObjectList) to safely
	remove a set of objects from the repository if no other objects
	are referring to them. The function is used by the "rm"
	command. In addition a new command "rrmdir" was added to remove a
	complete directory with all its objects and sub-directories. (The
	"rmdir" only removes empty directories.)

	* Repository/Repository.*: The "cp" command now treats particles
	separately (copyParticle()). If a particle has an anti-partner
	this is also copied to the same directory. In addition the decay
	modes of both particle and anti-particle will be copied.

	* PDT/DecayMode.cc: in constructDecayMode() it is now the default
	to specify the full name of the decaying particle (rather than
	just the PDGName).

2003-07-26  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* CLHEPWrap/*.fh, CLHEPWrap/*.h: Reordered include paths to
	prepare for next version of CLHEP which will use namespace CLHEP.

2003-07-25  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* PDT/DecayMode.*: Added new member variable to remember the order
	in which the decay products were specified. The produceProducts()
	now created particles according to this order.

	* src/ThePEGParticles.*, src/ThePEGDefaults.in,
	PDT/DummyDecayer.*: Added DummyDecayer class for symbolic decay
	channels. It replaces the PYDECYDummy decayer with mode 102.

	* src/ThePEGParticles.*, src/ThePEGDefaults.in,
	PDT/Tau2HadronsDecayer.*: Added class to decay tau to neutrino
	plus hadrons.

	* PDT/OmegaPhi3PiDecayer.cc: 

	* src/ThePEGParticles.in, src/ThePEGDefaults.in,
	PDT/DalitzDecayer.*: Added class to perform Dalitz decays into e+
	e- gamma.

2003-07-24  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* PDT/StandardMatchers.h: Added matcher classes for
	PseudoScalarMesons and VectorMesons.

	* src/ThePEGParticles.*, src/ThePEGDefaults.in, PDT/V2PPDecayer.*:
	Added V2PPDecayer class to decay vector mesons to pseudo-scalar
	ones. Will be flat in phase space unless the grand parent is a
	speudoscalar and its only other daughter is a speudo-scalar or a
	photon.

	* Repository/EventGenerator.icc: Added member functions and
	variables to access the current (partial) collision handler and
	the current step handler.

	* Handlers/PartialCollisionHandler.*: addStep() now has default
	null arguments for the step handler and the hint. If the hint is
	null, it is immediately converted to the default hint. If a step
	was added to a given group, the subsequent groups are
	automatically reinitialized.  In continueCollision(), the
	currentCollisionHandler() of the current event generator is set to
	this. In performStep() the currentStepHandler() in the current
	event generator is set to the step handler which is called.

	* Handlers/HandlerGroup.cc: next() will now return immediately for
	an empty group. addPreHandler(), addHint() and addPostHandler()
	now assumes (rightly) that the hint recieved is never null.
	addHint will refill the whole group event if there is the main
	handler is currently executing. I.e it is assumed that someone
	adding a hint to the main handler wants the whole group to be
	redone.

	* EventRecord/Collision.cc: Fixed so that if a perticle is removed
	from the event record its birthStep pointer is set to null.
	Hopefully this will fix the problem that sometimes when a
	generator is dumped (due to an error) a particle is written to a
	persistent stream and then tries to write a no longer existent
	birthStep.

2003-07-23  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* PDT/OmegaPhi3PiDecayer.*, src/ThePEGDefaults.in,
	src/ThePEGParticles.in: Added OmegaPhi3PiDecayer class to handle
	omega-phi->3pi decays.

	* lib/ThePEG.el: Added ThePEG-Decayer-class-files function.

	* PDT/FlatDecayer.cc: Now uses DecayMode::produceProducts().

	* src/ThePEGParticles.in, PDT/DecayMode.*: The naming of decay
	modes were before such that only the number and types of the decay
	products were important, this meant that it was not possible to
	have both eg. B0 -> c-cbar d-sbar and B0 -> c-sbar d-cbar decay
	modes since they have the same name and same representation.  Now
	the concept of links have been introduced to indicate that decay
	products can be linked together in pairs making two decay modes
	with the same decay products but different linking different. This
	is indicated in the name by an equal sign instead of a comma:
	B0->c=cbar,sbar=d; and B0->c=sbar,cbar=d;

	Also added a produceProducts() function to produce particles from
	the specified decay products, so that linked particles come first
	and consecutively in the returned vector.

2003-07-22  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* CLHEPWrap/Makefile: Added Matrix.h and Matrix.fh to the dist
	files.

	* lib/fixCLHEP: Make sure the fixed .so version of the CLHEP
	library is called libCLHEP.so irrespective of what the original
	CLHEP library was called.

	* MatrixElement/MEQQ2GG.cc, MatrixElement/MEQG2QG.cc: Fixed error
	in specification of intermediate particles (which was compensated
	by a corresponding error in the colour flow).

	* Makefile: Changed the version number to 1.0ab (between alpha and
	beta).

2003-07-21  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* lib/ThePEG.el: Added the parameter and switches functions which
	were forgotten in the move from skeleton.el

2003-07-20  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* EventRecord/Step.*: Added addDecayNoCheck(tPPtr parent, tPPtr
	child) and, addDecayProduct(tPPtr child) to add decay products
	which are already linked with their parents.

2003-07-19  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* PDF/RemnantHandler.*, PDF/PartonExtractor.*, PDF/PartonBin.*,
	PDF/PDF.*, PDF/NoRemnants.*, PDF/LeptonLeptonRemnant.*,
	PDF/BaryonRemnants.*, Handlers/XComb.*,
	Handlers/LastXCombInfo.icc, Handlers/CollisionHandler.cc: Removed
	all traces of old strategy involving the PartonBinInfo and
	RemnantInfo classes.

2003-07-16  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Utilities/DynamicLoader.cc: Added the current working directory
	as a standard search path. Also added '/' between paths and
	libraries if needed.

	* src/Makefile: Corrected link flags for setup and run programs.

	* Templates/Makefile, lib/Makefile: Moved ThePEG.el and g++dep to
	the lib directory.

	* Repository/EventGenerator.cc: Changed Pythia7 to ThePEG in
	generateReferences().

	* Handlers/StepHandler.cc: The createNewStep() function now
	automatically calles useMe()

	* Handlers/SubProcessHandler.*, Handlers/KinematicalCuts.*,
	Handlers/EventHandler.*, Handlers/CollisionHandler.*,
	Handlers/AnalysisHandler.*: Added fullclone() method to avoid
	slicing when making copies in the Repository.

	* Config/Makefile, Config/Makefile.common.in: Fixed correct
	include path for installed makefiles.

	* Makefile:  install now depends on the check target to ensure the
	setup and run programs are compiled.

	* ../configure: Added top-level configure script which simply runs
	configure in the sub-directories.

2003-07-14  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Config/Makefile: Removed config.h from DISTFILES.

	* Utilities/SimplePhaseSpace.cc: CMSn now throws
	ImpossibleKinematics if an infinite boost is requested.

	* Utilities/UtilityBase.*: Added new setMomentum function which
	doesn't boost to cms but just rotates to z-axis boosts along it
	and rotates to correct angle.

	* PDT/FlatDecayer.cc: Fixed precision problems for large boosts of
	decay products.

2003-07-13  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Config/Makefile.install: This file is copied to the lib dir in
	the installation and can be used to compile a users own .so
	modules.

	* lib/Makefile: The .o files included in libThePEG.so are now
	explicitly listed. The .so files in the listed sub-directories are
	explicitly soft-linked to the lib directory.

	* Config/Makefile.common.in: .o and .so files are no longer
	automatically soft-linked to the lib directory.

2003-07-12  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Templates/ThePEG.el: This elisp file will replace the old
	skeleton.el. The main difference is the renaming of the p7-*
	functions to thepeg-*. Also started to write specialized functions
	to create standard handler classes with templates for the virtual
	functions.

	* EventRecord/Step.cc: In addDecayProduct() remove test to see if
	children are still in the final state.

2003-07-08  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Utilities/SimplePhaseSpace.cc: Set the momentum of the first
	particle rather than boosting it to avoid problems with massless
	particles.

	* Makefile: Hid unnecessary output with @.

	* Utilities/UtilityBase.tcc: Fixed imediate returns in case ranges
	of particles is empty. In setMomentum the boost version is only
	tried if the invariant mass squared or the mass is non-negative,
	otherwise the momentum is set directly.

	* Utilities/Exception.cc: Added a debug function to print out a
	range of particles (and summing their momenta).

	* PDT/ParticleData.h: Added produceParticle method which takes a
	Lorentz vector and a mass.

	* PDF/LeptonLeptonRemnant.*: Added parameter to veto photon
	remnants with too small energy fractions. Also the photons mass is
	properly set to zero.

	* Handlers/ClusterCollapser.cc: The procedure to find particles to
	compensate with was changed so that coloured particles are tried
	first and singlets only if the coloured particles were not enough.
	Also required the compensating particles to have a positive
	invariant mass squared to avoid boost problems.

	* EventRecord/ColourSinglet.*: Introduced ColourSingletException
	which is thrown if an inconsistent colour flow is detected.

2003-07-07  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Utilities/Exception.cc: Added debug function to print out
	particle.

	* Handlers/ClusterCollapser.cc: Fixed bug for the case where mass
	of compensating particle is 0.

2003-07-05  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Utilities/UtilityBase.tcc: Fixed bug in transformToCMS(): boos
	was backward.

	* Utilities/UtilityBase.*: Added transformToMomentum() method.

	* Utilities/SimplePhaseSpace.cc: Fixed potential problem in
	getMagnitude() where impossible kinematics didn't generate an
	exception due to rounding errors.

	* EventRecord/Step.*: Added setCopy method.

	* CLHEPWrap/Transverse.icc: Fixed bug in phi() calculation.

2003-07-04  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* PDF/PartonExtractor.cc: Messed around with the newRemnants
	methods.

	* Utilities/ObjectIndexer.icc: Fixed memory leak in
	operator()(Int).

2003-07-03  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Handlers/StepHandler.h: Added method and member for getting the
	current step from the collision handler.

	* PDF/PartonExtractor.*: Changed return type on newRemnants method.

	* Utilities/ObjectIndexer.*: Added const method for getting object
	from index without possibility to create corresponding object.

	* EventRecord/Step.*: Added insertCopy method.

2003-07-02  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* PDF/PartonBin.*: Added information about outgoing bins in
	addition to the info about the incoming bin.

	* PDF/PartonExtractor.*, Handlers/XComb.*,
	Handlers/CollisionHandler.*: Changed to use PartonBinInstance
	instead of PartonBinInfo.

	* EventRecord/Step.*: Added removeDecayProducts methods.

2003-07-01  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Handlers/XComb.cc: Fixed floating underflow problem due to
	uninitialized field in constructor.

2003-06-30  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Handlers/XComb.*: Prepared to use the new PartonBinInstance
	class.

	* PDF/PartonExtractor.*: Prepared to use the new PartonBinInstance
	class.

	* PDF/RemnantHandler.*, PDF/NoRemnants.*,
	PDF/LeptonLeptonRemnant.*, PDF/BaryonRemnants.*: Prepared to use
	the new PartonBinInstance class.

	* PDF/PartonBinInstance.*: Added new class to hold info on parton
	bins. Instead of a PartonBin having a ParonBinInfo to keep
	temporary info, PartonBinInstance keeps a PartonBin together with
	temporary info.

	* CLHEPWrap/Transverse.h: Added units for input/output to streams.

2003-06-28  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* PDF/PartonExtractor.cc: Fixed association beteen partons and
	parton bins for generated sub-processes (used to find PDFs for
	partons).

2003-06-23  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Utilities/ObjectIndexer.*: Added templated class for dynamical
	association between (reference counted) objects and indices.

	* Handlers/StepHandler.*, Handlers/PartialCollisionHandler.cc: In
	preparation for changing the signature of the handle() method i
	StepHandler classes, StepHandler now has a method to return the
	collision handler which made the call to handle(), The
	corresponding member variable is set be the
	PartialCollisionHandler before handle() is called. Also the
	StepHandler class now has its own method to create a new step if
	needed.

	* PDT/FlatDecayer.cc: The scale of all decay products in a decay
	is set to the squared mass of the decaying particle.

	* Handlers/XComb.cc: The scale of all incoming and outgoing
	partons in a sub-process is set to the hard scale.

	* Handlers/DecayHandler.cc: The scale of a particle which has
	decayed is set to zero.

2003-06-16  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Repository/Repository.cc: Added code so that the load() command
	will look in the ThePEG_INSTALL_PATH for a .rpo file if the given
	filename did not exist.

2003-06-14  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* First check-in of ThePEG. This is just what was previously
	Pythia7 but stripped from any pythia-specific classes.  Pythia7
	still exists but contains only pythia-specific classes which
	depend on ThePEG.

	Most significant change is that the 'Misc' directory has been
	removed and all classes therin has been moved to the 'Utilities'
	directory. 

	Another change is that 'make check' now only checks the SimpleLEP
	generator since the SimpleLHC generator was indirectly dependent
	on the FlavourGenerator in the pythia string fragmentation classes
	(used in the remnant handling).

	When compiling, the full compiler and link commands are now by
	default replaced by messages such as 'comiling xxx.cc ...' To see
	the full commands use the make-variable SHOWCOMMAND eg. 'make -k
	check SHOWCOMMAND=1'
