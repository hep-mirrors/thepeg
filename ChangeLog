	* PDF/PartonExtractor.cc: Fixed association beteen partons and
	parton bins for generated sub-processes (used to find PDFs for
	partons).

	* Utilities/ObjectIndexer.*: Added templated class for dynamical
	association between (reference counted) objects and indices.

	* Handlers/StepHandler.*, Handlers/PartialCollisionHandler.cc: In
	preparation for changing the signature of the handle() method i
	StepHandler classes, StepHandler now has a method to return the
	collision handler which made the call to handle(), The
	corresponding member variable is set be the
	PartialCollisionHandler before handle() is called. Also the
	StepHandler class now has its own method to create a new step if
	needed.

	* PDT/FlatDecayer.cc: The scale of all decay products in a decay
	is set to the squared mass of the decaying particle.

	* Handlers/XComb.cc: The scale of all incoming and outgoing
	partons in a sub-process is set to the hard scale.

	* Handlers/DecayHandler.cc: The scale of a particle which has
	decayed is set to zero.

	* Repository/Repository.cc: Added code so that the load() command
	will look in the ThePEG_INSTALL_PATH for a .rpo file if the given
	filename did not exist.

	* First check-in of ThePEG. This is just what was previously
	Pythia7 but stripped from any pythia-specific classes.  Pythia7
	still exists but contains only pythia-specific classes which
	depend on ThePEG.

	Most significant change is that the 'Misc' directory has been
	removed and all classes therin has been moved to the 'Utilities'
	directory. 

	Another change is that 'make check' now only checks the SimpleLEP
	generator since the SimpleLHC generator was indirectly dependent
	on the FlavourGenerator in the pythia string fragmentation classes
	(used in the remnant handling).

	When compiling, the full compiler and link commands are now by
	default replaced by messages such as 'comiling xxx.cc ...' To see
	the full commands use the make-variable SHOWCOMMAND eg. 'make -k
	check SHOWCOMMAND=1'
