2003-07-16  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Utilities/DynamicLoader.cc: Added the current working directory
	as a standard search path. Also added '/' between paths and
	libraries if needed.

	* src/Makefile: Corrected link flags for setup and run programs.

	* Templates/Makefile, lib/Makefile: Moved ThePEG.el and g++dep to
	the lib directory.

	* Repository/EventGenerator.cc: Changed Pythia7 to ThePEG in
	generateReferences().

	* Handlers/StepHandler.cc: The createNewStep() function now
	automatically calles useMe()

	* Handlers/SubProcessHandler.*, Handlers/KinematicalCuts.*,
	Handlers/EventHandler.*, Handlers/CollisionHandler.*,
	Handlers/AnalysisHandler.*: Added fullclone() method to avoid
	slicing when making copies in the Repository.

	* Config/Makefile, Config/Makefile.common.in: Fixed correct
	include path for installed makefiles.

	* Makefile:  install now depends on the check target to ensure the
	setup and run programs are compiled.

	* ../configure: Added top-level configure script which simply runs
	configure in the sub-directories.

2003-07-14  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Config/Makefile: Removed config.h from DISTFILES.

	* Utilities/SimplePhaseSpace.cc: CMSn now throws
	ImpossibleKinematics if an infinite boost is requested.

	* Utilities/UtilityBase.*: Added new setMomentum function which
	doesn't boost to cms but just rotates to z-axis boosts along it
	and rotates to correct angle.

	* PDT/FlatDecayer.cc: Fixed precision problems for large boosts of
	decay products.

2003-07-13  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Config/Makefile.install: This file is copied to the lib dir in
	the installation and can be used to compile a users own .so
	modules.

	* lib/Makefile: The .o files included in libThePEG.so are now
	explicitly listed. The .so files in the listed sub-directories are
	explicitly soft-linked to the lib directory.

	* Config/Makefile.common.in: .o and .so files are no longer
	automatically soft-linked to the lib directory.

2003-07-12  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Templates/ThePEG.el: This elisp file will replace the old
	skeleton.el. The main difference is the renaming of the p7-*
	functions to thepeg-*. Also started to write specialized functions
	to create standard handler classes with templates for the virtual
	functions.

	* EventRecord/Step.cc: In addDecayProduct() remove test to see if
	children are still in the final state.

2003-07-08  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Utilities/SimplePhaseSpace.cc: Set the momentum of the first
	particle rather than boosting it to avoid problems with massless
	particles.

	* Makefile: Hid unnecessary output with @.

	* Utilities/UtilityBase.tcc: Fixed imediate returns in case ranges
	of particles is empty. In setMomentum the boost version is only
	tried if the invariant mass squared or the mass is non-negative,
	otherwise the momentum is set directly.

	* Utilities/Exception.cc: Added a debug function to print out a
	range of particles (and summing their momenta).

	* PDT/ParticleData.h: Added produceParticle method which takes a
	Lorentz vector and a mass.

	* PDF/LeptonLeptonRemnant.*: Added parameter to veto photon
	remnants with too small energy fractions. Also the photons mass is
	properly set to zero.

	* Handlers/ClusterCollapser.cc: The procedure to find particles to
	compensate with was changed so that coloured particles are tried
	first and singlets only if the coloured particles were not enough.
	Also required the compensating particles to have a positive
	invariant mass squared to avoid boost problems.

	* EventRecord/ColourSinglet.*: Introduced ColourSingletException
	which is thrown if an inconsistent colour flow is detected.

2003-07-07  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Utilities/Exception.cc: Added debug function to print out
	particle.

	* Handlers/ClusterCollapser.cc: Fixed bug for the case where mass
	of compensating particle is 0.

2003-07-05  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Utilities/UtilityBase.tcc: Fixed bug in transformToCMS(): boos
	was backward.

	* Utilities/UtilityBase.*: Added transformToMomentum() method.

	* Utilities/SimplePhaseSpace.cc: Fixed potential problem in
	getMagnitude() where impossible kinematics didn't generate an
	exception due to rounding errors.

	* EventRecord/Step.*: Added setCopy method.

	* CLHEPWrap/Transverse.icc: Fixed bug in phi() calculation.

2003-07-04  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* PDF/PartonExtractor.cc: Messed around with the newRemnants
	methods.

	* Utilities/ObjectIndexer.icc: Fixed memory leak in
	operator()(Int).

2003-07-03  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Handlers/StepHandler.h: Added method and member for getting the
	current step from the collision handler.

	* PDF/PartonExtractor.*: Changed return type on newRemnants method.

	* Utilities/ObjectIndexer.*: Added const method for getting object
	from index without possibility to create corresponding object.

	* EventRecord/Step.*: Added insertCopy method.

2003-07-02  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* PDF/PartonBin.*: Added information about outgoing bins in
	addition to the info about the incoming bin.

	* PDF/PartonExtractor.*, Handlers/XComb.*,
	Handlers/CollisionHandler.*: Changed to use PartonBinInstance
	instead of PartonBinInfo.

	* EventRecord/Step.*: Added removeDecayProducts methods.

2003-07-01  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Handlers/XComb.cc: Fixed floating underflow problem due to
	uninitialized field in constructor.

2003-06-30  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Handlers/XComb.*: Prepared to use the new PartonBinInstance
	class.

	* PDF/PartonExtractor.*: Prepared to use the new PartonBinInstance
	class.

	* PDF/RemnantHandler.*, PDF/NoRemnants.*,
	PDF/LeptonLeptonRemnant.*, PDF/BaryonRemnants.*: Prepared to use
	the new PartonBinInstance class.

	* PDF/PartonBinInstance.*: Added new class to hold info on parton
	bins. Instead of a PartonBin having a ParonBinInfo to keep
	temporary info, PartonBinInstance keeps a PartonBin together with
	temporary info.

	* CLHEPWrap/Transverse.h: Added units for input/output to streams.

2003-06-28  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* PDF/PartonExtractor.cc: Fixed association beteen partons and
	parton bins for generated sub-processes (used to find PDFs for
	partons).

2003-06-23  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Utilities/ObjectIndexer.*: Added templated class for dynamical
	association between (reference counted) objects and indices.

	* Handlers/StepHandler.*, Handlers/PartialCollisionHandler.cc: In
	preparation for changing the signature of the handle() method i
	StepHandler classes, StepHandler now has a method to return the
	collision handler which made the call to handle(), The
	corresponding member variable is set be the
	PartialCollisionHandler before handle() is called. Also the
	StepHandler class now has its own method to create a new step if
	needed.

	* PDT/FlatDecayer.cc: The scale of all decay products in a decay
	is set to the squared mass of the decaying particle.

	* Handlers/XComb.cc: The scale of all incoming and outgoing
	partons in a sub-process is set to the hard scale.

	* Handlers/DecayHandler.cc: The scale of a particle which has
	decayed is set to zero.

2003-06-16  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Repository/Repository.cc: Added code so that the load() command
	will look in the ThePEG_INSTALL_PATH for a .rpo file if the given
	filename did not exist.

2003-06-14  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* First check-in of ThePEG. This is just what was previously
	Pythia7 but stripped from any pythia-specific classes.  Pythia7
	still exists but contains only pythia-specific classes which
	depend on ThePEG.

	Most significant change is that the 'Misc' directory has been
	removed and all classes therin has been moved to the 'Utilities'
	directory. 

	Another change is that 'make check' now only checks the SimpleLEP
	generator since the SimpleLHC generator was indirectly dependent
	on the FlavourGenerator in the pythia string fragmentation classes
	(used in the remnant handling).

	When compiling, the full compiler and link commands are now by
	default replaced by messages such as 'comiling xxx.cc ...' To see
	the full commands use the make-variable SHOWCOMMAND eg. 'make -k
	check SHOWCOMMAND=1'
