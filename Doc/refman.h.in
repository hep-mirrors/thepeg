\section ThePEGIntroduction Introduction

ThePEG is a general toolkit for implementing physics models of event
generation in high energy particle collisions. It defines a general
structure of event generation in terms of abstract base classes for
eg. hard partonic matrix elements, parton showers and the decay of
unstable particles. Different models are then implemented by creating
classes which inherits from these base classes and implements sets
of pre-defined virtual functions.
